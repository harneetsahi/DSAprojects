## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
> repo contains some DSA concepts like linkedList project, hashMap project, binary search tree project by The Odin Project.

This folder has different javascript files for each of these projects.
Refer to the following for reference to respective files:

### Linked-list (code in script.js)

As part of DSA, linkedlist allows us to add and remove elements with ease since it contains reference to the next node.

### HashMap (code in hash.js)

Stores key-value pairs

### Balanced Binary Search Tree (code in balancedBst.js)

A balanced binary tree is a type of binary tree where the height difference (or balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is minimal.
